Used Libraries in this project:

- Alamofire : it is an HTTP networking library written in Swift.
- AlamofireImage : An image library including image response serializers, UIImage and UIImageView extensions, custom image filters, an auto-purging in-memory cache and a priority-based image downloading system.
I have used this two libraries to optimize the download of the data and to make it faster and accessible for the user.
- Swifty Json : it is a library that makes easier to deal with JSON data in Swift.
- Easy Tip View: it is a fully customisable tooltip view written in Swift that can be used as a call to action or informative tip. I have used it to inform the user that the filters are active.
- Sweet Alert: it's a custom alert that give you the possibility to show error, warning, success message to user.
- Page menu: it's a tab menu that I have customized adding the possibility to put an image in the tab menu section.
